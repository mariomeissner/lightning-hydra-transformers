## About this Template
This template is a fork of the fantastic [lightning-hydra-template](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template), modified to work smoothly with Huggingface Transformers and Huggingface Datasets. It contains an example of how to train Bert on the MNLI text classification task.

This template is very similar to the work done by the Lightning team in [lightning-transformers](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/lightning-transformers), with the difference being that the template in this repository is simple, lightweight and very close to the original and beloved lightning-hydra-template mentioned above. It can be useful to reference [lightning-transformers](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/lightning-transformers) when implementing some complex usecase, but I personally found it useful to keep things simple, hence why I use this template instead of [lightning-transformers](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/lightning-transformers).

Have a look at the original repository for a complete README with all the details.

## Who I Recommend this Template To

Everyone! I think the research community in general can benefit from using a more structured approach like this. However, a basic understanding of PyTorch Lightning and Hydra are necessary for comfortable use. Make sure to check out those projects first before getting your hands dirty here.
